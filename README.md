# Benford's Law Checker
A small script that will allow you to check if file(s) or url(s) are considered Benford's Law "Compliant".

*Warning*: I am not a datascientist nor a math expert so do not consider this code as accurate as you may think (effort taken is very low here and not optimized shell calls)

# What is the Benford's Law?
According to online resources the Benfordâ€™s law (also called the first digit law) states that the leading digits in a collection of data sets are probably going to be small. <br>
In a nutshell, if we have a dataset containing numbers we will mostlikely find numbers starting with 1,2,3,4,5 since these will cover almost 75% of the number distribution (e.g. starting with 1 - 31% , 2 17% etc..)
